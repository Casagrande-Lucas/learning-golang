# 12. Exercises to Reinforce Learning

### **Exercise 1: Custom Types and Methods**
- Define a custom type Temperature as float64.
- Implement methods to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Create instances and demonstrate the conversions.

### **Exercise 2: Struct Embedding and Interfaces**
- Define an interface Notifier with a method Notify(message string).
- Create structs EmailNotifier and SMSNotifier that implement Notifier.
- Embed these notifiers in a User struct and demonstrate polymorphic behavior.

### **Exercise 3: Safe Map Usage**
- Create a concurrent-safe map using sync.RWMutex.
- Implement functions to get, set, and delete map entries safely.
- Write a program that concurrently accesses the map to verify thread safety.

### **Exercise 4: Type Assertions and Switches**
- Create a function that accepts an interface{} parameter.
- Use type assertions and switches to handle different underlying types.
- Demonstrate the function with various input types.
